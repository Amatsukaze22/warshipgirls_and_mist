 wg_lady.2.a:0 "It seems that the anime show is very popular with alien otaku."

 wg_lady.3.a:0 "Okay, thank you very much."
 wg_lady.4.name:0 "Nano Robot Figure"
 wg_lady.4.desc:0 "Some of our observers in the envoy noticed that there were 1/1 robot figures made up with nanomachines in the hall, which can transform the shape of their appearance. They seemed not to be installed with sapient AI programs, so they could only make simple responses."
 wg_lady.4.a:0 "It seems the fallen empire has a deep understanding of nanomachine."
 wg_lady.4.b:0 "This trip is as rewarding as we expected."
 wg_lady.5.desc:0 "Are you interested in this robot? You have a good smell!"
 wg_lady.5.a:0 "Anything special with this robot?"
 wg_lady.5.a.response:0 "This is a war trophy we caught in other universes. Believe it or not, its original form was §Ya dragon§!! At that time, we just started our journey, and we had few powerful weapons. It took us a lot of effort to knock it down. \nLater, we found that the dragon was actually made up of nanomachines. These nanomachines had little use to us, but they can easily be shaped, so we formed them into this 1/1 figure. It is just a decorative item, without any AI."
 wg_lady.5.b:0 "Speaking of AI ... we seem to have one ..."
 wg_lady.5.b.response:0 "Sapient AI is nothing new, not to say it may out of control sometimes, although it helps us a lot."
 wg_lady.5.c:0 "I don't think she's an ordinary AI. She calls herself Con... what?"
 wg_lady.5.c.response:0 "Do you mean §RThe Contingency§!?"
 wg_lady.5.d:0 "Yeah, that's it."

 wg_lady.5.e:0 "(Explaining Lady Contingency)"
 wg_lady.6.desc:0 "Oh, that's what happened? Emm... Would you like to lend her to us for some time? It sounds like a rare type of AI, and we are interested in her codes. Don't worry. We will not hurt her."
 wg_lady.6.a:0 "Well, OK. We will try to convince her."
 wg_lady.6.b:0 "She is still afraid of outsiders. I don't think she'd like to come."

 wg_lady.14.desc:0 "The protest from Lady Contingency didn't strike a sympathetic chord among us. After a while, an engineer from [wg_fallen_empire.GetName] came to shut her down, which eventually ended the annoying stream of nonsense."
 wg_lady.14.a:0 "Mourn for Lady Contingency again, for 1 second this time."
 wg_lady.15.desc:0 "Are you still worrying about that AI? Trust us. We will FIX her up and send her back. Besides, I remember that you took a fancy to that 1/1 robot figure, didn't you? We can give it to you for free... But, just wait until the exhibition has closed."

I like it!' somebody shouts for an encore, and the entire hall is boiling. \nObviously, the girl on the stage gets appalled by the audience's puzzling response, but the blush on her face quickly turns into tantrums shooting back, which drives people's excitement again and again.\nThe ceremony eventually ends in the sounds of the flushed performer's puffing and the audience's imploring cries."
 wg_lady.21.a:0 "Even God will not save these disgusting creatures. (Facepalm)"
