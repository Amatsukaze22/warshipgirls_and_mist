 weapon_dmm_request_desc: "Can we design a powerful defense weapon for us?"
 weapon_dmm_request_desc_response: "Actually, like the huge explosion caused by Miss Changchun, the dark matter will release extremely huge energy when it contacts the alpha crystal. The cost of defensive weapons should not be too high, so we can separate the dark matter from the alpha crystal. In the two halves of the alloy shell, something similar to traditional mines is made. Spreading these mines in the galaxy can form an insurmountable minefield. However, the design and manufacture of this shell, the pretreatment of alpha crystals and dark matter require a lot of resources And research investment. \ N§All research on the Empire will be suspended during the R project! §! "
 sh_mine_request_desc_response: "The reason why the deep-sea energy core produces a large amount of lethal radiation is that it is unstable. Injecting dark matter into the deep-sea energy core will greatly increase its instability. This unstable core cannot be made into a shipborne weapon, but it is scattered It may serve as a powerful space mine in galaxy space. This project that may cause a fatal explosion requires a lot of resources and research investment. \ N§All research on the Empire will be suspended during the R project! §! "

 combat_uf_request_response: "The United is our old friend, we can say that they know quite well, we know some weaknesses that even your red children don't know about. \nOf course these weaknesses require extensive modification of your weapons , It takes time. §! \ N§All research on the Empire will be suspended during the R project! §!
