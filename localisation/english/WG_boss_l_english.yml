She came from a planet called Terra.\n\nNatural disasters, which the Terrans called them Catastrophes, were frequent in the world Terra. A Catastrophe would leave a large number of high-energy minerals, the Originiums, at its site. Terrans made use of Originiums to develop unique technologies, and some Terrans could even control the energy inside. The people on Terra benefited from those Originium Arts, although their detailed theory still remained unknown.\n\nHowever, Originium was not without its dangers, as prolonged exposure might cause a progressive, terminal disease known as Oripathy. The Originium would not only corrade the infector's body but also turn the person into a source of infection.\n\nAstesia was an infector. At the edge of her death, she sent a distress signal through her Art -- Astrology. That message was received by a passerby science ship of the Endordia Empire. Unfortunately, the Empire had nothing can do to deal with Oripathy, but their scientist still tried to preserve her consciousness and memory with an experimental technology after her death.\n\nThat technology was about memory operations. For further researches, Endordia's scientist rewrote Astesia's memory, that she was born and grew up in Endordia, not in Terra. The operation was a total success. Astesia finally became the highest weapon researcher of the Empire, then became the core of a Science Nexus."
