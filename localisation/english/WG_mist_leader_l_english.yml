 wsg_shimakaze.1.desc: "Recently, when Dr. Yubari returned to the high-energy physics laboratory, he discovered a girl who was fainted on the ground. After inspection, the ship mother just passed out. She woke up in this ship mother. After we arrived, we also learned the ins and outs of the matter. This ship's mother is called Shimakaze, from Cangqing World. She was inhaled by the wormhole generated by Dr. Yubari's experiment a month ago. After collecting data and blocking the laboratory, the Shimakaze was locked in the laboratory for three days and three nights. Dr. Yubari took the Shimakaze out of the harbor area for guilt, and bought a new suit for the Shimakaze. A few days ago, the Shimakaze conveyed the wish of the secretary ship to join the port area.
